        Digital transformation refers to the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business,
        fundamentally changing how organizations operate and deliver value to customers. It involves a cultural
        shift that requires organizations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and become comfortable
        with failure. Digital transformation encompasses cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics,
        and automation to enhance efficiency and customer experience.
